<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a second-year PhD student in the MIx Group at the School of Computer Science, [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/), under the supervision of Prof. [Jianbo Jiao](https://jianbojiao.com/).

Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Xiâ€™an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/) in 2023.

My research interests focus on open-world learning and multi-modal learning, particularly in the intersection of vision and language.
